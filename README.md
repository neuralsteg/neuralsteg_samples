# Samples for Neural Linguistic Steganography

In each file, the format is "human generated context (3 sentences)", "cover sentence", "bits per word encoded in cover".

In addition to samples from the different methods with different values of their control parameter, "swap_sents" gives a baseline where the next sentence is randomly selected from the the rest of the article. "true_data" gives a baseline where the next sentence is the true next sentence.
